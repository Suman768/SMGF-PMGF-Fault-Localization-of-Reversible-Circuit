# SMGF-PMGF-Fault-Localization-of-Reversible-Circuit
The aim of fault localization in reversible circuits is to accurately identify Single Missing Gate Fault (SMGF) and Partial Missing Gate Fault (PMGF) to ensure the circuit's correct functionality and reliability. This process enhances the circuit's performance and supports efficient maintenance and repair.
